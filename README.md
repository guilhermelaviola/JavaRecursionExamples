# JavaRecursionExamples
A few basic examples that show what recursion is and how it works.

## What is recursion?
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve. Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.
